# 📝 React + TypeScript Todo App — Built for a React Basics Workshop

This is a simple yet production-style Todo App built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

It was created as part of a live coding session in a React Fundamentals workshop, covering:

- Functional components & JSX
- State management with useState
- Controlled components & form handling
- Props and component reusability
- Clean project structure with TypeScript

🔧 No external state libraries — just React & TS best practices.

📦 Bootstrapped with Vite for fast dev experience.
